My [dotfiles](https://dotfiles.github.io/) are managed with [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/), based on [Brandon Invergo's approach](http://brandon.invergo.net/news/2012-05-26-using-gnu-stow-to-manage-your-dotfiles.html).

## Required packages

Assuming Arch:

```bash
# pacman -S curl zsh git
```

[oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh):

```bash
$ sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```
